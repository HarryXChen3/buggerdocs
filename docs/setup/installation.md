# Installation
[latest release](https://github.com/HarryXChen3/bugger/releases/latest)

*bugger is currently unstable, and will most likely undergo breaking changes until it's first stable release!*

---

How do I use this release? there's only a zip of the source!
> bugger is meant to be dropped directly into your project by unzipping the source

Where do I put the unzipped folder?
> bugger should be put into `ReplicatedStorage`, as you'll need to require it from both client and server

Is bugger available on any package managers?
> Nope. There are no first-party releases on any package managers. (you are welcome to upload it yourself!)
